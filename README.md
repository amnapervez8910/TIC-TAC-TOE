## Code Structure

- `TicTacToe` class encapsulates the game logic:  
  - `square` vector holds the current board state.  
  - `checkWin()` checks the game status (win/draw/ongoing).  
  - `drawBoard()` displays the board.  
  - `playGame()` controls the game loop and player input.

---

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later (for example, g++, clang++, MSVC).  
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.
